 codegenerator usage:
 =====================
	cd [o3 path]/tool/win32
	o3.exe ../codegen.js
 
	This will regenerate every glue for o3, in the o3/include folder
	(whenever it finds a source file with o3_glue_gen() macro in it,
	it will parse the file and generate glue for it)
 
	By default you it will create codegenErr.txt and codegenLog.txt
	for the error and log messages.
 
	additional parameters:
	- you can specify specific folders and files instead of generating 
	  all the glues: 
			o3.exe ../codegen.js ../../include/fs ../../include/image/o3_cImage1_win32.h
	- flags:
		'-l' : print the log messages after the codegen has finished
		'-v' : print every log message during the process
		'-trace' : tracing the javascript includes
 
 
 tags:
 ======
    o3_get	- property getter trait
		o3_get int prop()
    o3_set	- property setter trait
		o3_get int setProp()				
    	
	NOTE: the two example, prop and setProp will generate a property called prop
	on the component, please note the naming convention, no prefix for the getter
	set prefix for the setter. If one of the traits is missing then it will be a read
	or write only property accordingly.
	
	as immediate properties:
		o3_get int m_member;
		o3_set int m_member;
		o3_prop int m_member;  
	
	NOTE: naming convention is also important here, the c++ 'm_some_name' member 
	variable will become 'someMember' property on the js object. The js name can 
	be altered by the o3_name tag;
			
	o3_fun	- method trait, adds a method to the current component
		virtual o3_fun siScr parseString(const char* str)

	o3_ext - it is possible to add method trait to other components, as extension traits
		static o3_ext("cO3") o3_fun siScr screen(iCtx* ctx)
		

	NOTE: for a javascript method there can belong several overload, during the script call
	the right overload will be selected based on the argument counts and their type. More
	details comming soon.	
		
    o3_enum	- create read only properties
		o3_enum("nameOfEnum", value1, value2, value3 = 4, value4) 

	o3_name - alters the name of the js property
		o3_name("someName") o3_prop int m_member;
		o3_name("someOtherName") o3_fun int ___custom_name__();
